Signs use vigor, which in turn costs you melee damage and speed (razor focus talent) and lowers the effectiveness of the next sign. They should not be spammed. Stuns, however, usually give you both the room to regenerate stamina, poise or health, and the opportunity for a free melee attack. This almost always trumps pure damage. Signs with an unreliable stun like Igni and Axii can be cast on a poise-broken enemy to guarantee the eect.</p><div class="tabs" id="i7wg2ix_324" data-anchors="[i7wg2ix_325,i7wg2ix_331,i7wg2ix_336,i7wg2ix_347,i7wg2ix_353]"><div class="tabs__content" data-gtm="tab" id="i7wg2ix_325" data-title="Aard"><p><b id="i7wg2ix_326"><img alt="Aard Symbol" src="images/Tw2_sign_aard.webp" class="inline-icon-" title="Aard Symbol" id="i7wg2ix_327"> Aard</b></p><p id="i7wg2ix_328">Mainly good for a reliable stagger, but can later give an extremely powerful stun + damage when combined with rime oil, frost bolts, or Northern Wind. <img alt="Aard Symbol" src="images/Tw2_sign_aard.webp" class="inline-icon-" title="Aard Symbol" id="i7wg2ix_329"> Aard on a poise broken smaller enemy will knock them down for an instant kill.

I have not been able to make the rst two work well: the damage of alt Igni is pretty high, but in my experience rarely high enough to justify keeping you stationary while burning vigor. Best use I nd is to nish o a low enemy. Similarly, in most fights in which armor reduction would be useful, I nd that the vigor is better spent on other signs, and other armor penetration will do a better job. So the best remaining use in my eyes is as the group stun via burning. It is quicker than Yrden and longer than <img alt="Aard Symbol" src="images/Tw2_sign_aard.webp" class="inline-icon-" title="Aard Symbol" id="i7wg2ix_335"> Aard, and works pretty nicely after leveling up the corresponding talent a bit. With some additional increase in sign intensity e.g. via a place of power, potion or rune burn chance gets close to 100% and becomes a reliable tool.</p></div><div class="tabs__content" data-gtm="tab" id="i7wg2ix_336" data-title="Quen"><p><b id="i7wg2ix_337"><img alt="Quen Symbol" src="images/Tw2_sign_quen.webp" class="inline-icon-" title="Quen Symbol" id="i7wg2ix_338"> Quen</b></p><p id="i7wg2ix_339">Remember: When you hold up this sign, the enemy is legally required to give you stamina instead of damage Regular Quen is useful, but boring.</p><p id="i7wg2ix_340">I tend to avoid it as a self-imposed rule.</p><p id="i7wg2ix_341">Otherwise, it is best used against area and other unblockable damage, though it will obviously cushion any mistake you make.</p><p id="i7wg2ix_342">But it is a crutch that will keep you from using other signs, so move away from it ASAP for fun and prot.</p><p id="i7wg2ix_343">Alt Quen is a lot more difficult to use, but also much more fun and immersive.

Most of your fights will be against groups of small enemies, but later upgraded signs can quickly kill or at least deactivate groups, and the hardest fights tend to be against single enemies. On the other hand, in light armor a single mistake can lead to a chain of staggers and kill you. There is no clear overall answer. I tend to either switch from heavy to light depending on the situation, or just stick to medium armor. You can always compensate for the weakness of an armor with potions and mutagens. As an example, cat and tanny towl can make dodging easier in heavy, while armor mutagens and full moon ensure that a single mistake is not your last in light.</p><aside class="prompt" data-type="tip" data-title="" id="i7wg2ix_361"><p id="i7wg2ix_362">Care for your Swords, Soldier.</p></aside><p id="i7wg2ix_363"><br> As with armor, it can make fights easier to match your sword to your enemy type.
