But each revival will cost you in skills, attributes, and equipment.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_3">This is my attempt at a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; permadeath mode that also addresses issues of player scaling. W3EE&rsquo;s enemy scaling option is fine, but I&rsquo;ve always preferred downscaling player progression over upscaling enemies.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_4">It&rsquo;s important to note that spent skill points are not valid material for revival, so properly engaging with this mode means carefully choosing where your skill points are most needed and saving the rest.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_5">Gaunter Mode will not affect your game saves in any way. A Game Over screen might mean you failed the challenge, but whether you go ahead and finish your playthrough should be left up to the player.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_6">Why &ldquo;Gaunter&rdquo; Mode? Because immortality is expensive, and like Olgierd, you may come to find it was too steep a price.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_7">Notes:</p><p id="-fy5ea9_8">You can enable the mode in an existing save without issue. I recommend taking a clearing potion so you can set up your skills accordingly, and consider increasing the costs and penalties to offset any missed deaths and your stronger power level.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_9">If you&rsquo;ve unlocked the Second Life Mutation, that will trigger before Gaunter Mode&rsquo;s version and you won&rsquo;t need to pay, unless you die again during Second Life&rsquo;s cooldown.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_10">The Second Life Quen shield is partially affected by Quen skills, so think about investing in &lsquo;Active Shield&rsquo; to reduce the passive Vigor drain while you revive.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_11">Very often Second Life will revive you with just under 100% Vitality (for some reason), so Vitality regen is useful in order to clear injuries.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_12">Due to skill progress slowing the more skills you&rsquo;ve obtained from that branch, it may be beneficial to designate &ldquo;dump skills&rdquo; where you spend few if any points in order to keep the XP rate high.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_13">Reinforcement Glyphs, +Durability% attributes, Oils + Fixative skill, or Bereavement will reduce (or eliminate) durability loss from revival.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_14">Options:</p><p id="-fy5ea9_15">Toggles the mode on or off. If you later disable the mode, your attributes will be restored to normal but you will not recover any lost skill points or skill progress.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_16">This is the number of skill points + skill progress required for revival. Only unspent skills are valid. Skill points will be taken at random and, if there aren&rsquo;t enough, skills will be randomly selected and have their progress taken until the requirement is met.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_17">If set to 0, revival is free and unlimited unless a &lsquo;Death Limit&rsquo; option is set.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_18">This is a modifier that adds 1 to the &lsquo;Skill Point Requirement&rsquo; for every x skill points spent. For instance if this option is set to 10, &lsquo;Skill Point Requirement&rsquo; is set to 5, and you have 22 skill points invested in skills, your final skill point requirement will be 7.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_19">If set to 0 it will be unused.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_20">As you progress through the game, certain main quests will reduce your death counter by this value. The specific quests are:</p><p id="-fy5ea9_21">Main Game: Family Matters The Ladies of the Wood Get Junior A Poet Under Pressure Nameless Ugly Baby The Battle of Kaer Morhen Bald Mountain Final Preparations The Sunstone</p><p id="-fy5ea9_22">Hearts of Stone: Open Sesame! Whatsoever a Man Soweth</p><p id="-fy5ea9_23">Blood &amp; Wine: La Cage au Fou The Night of Long Fangs Pomp and Strange Circumstance</p><p id="-fy5ea9_24">After reviving, if you die again within 5 minutes you will accrue additional deaths equal to this value.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_25">This is a hard limit on the number of times you can be revived. If this were set to 10, your Death Counter could read 10, but dying again would trigger a Game Over.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_26">A setting of 0 means there is no limit.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_27">Your Maximum Vitality will be reduced by this amount for each Death. If you change this value, it will update retroactively but only on a new death or reloading a save.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_28">Your Maximum Stamina will be reduced by this amount for each Death. If you change this value, it will update retroactively but only on a new death or reloading a save.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_29">Your Maximum Toxicity will be reduced by this amount for each Death. If you change this value, it will update retroactively but only on a new death or reloading a save.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_30">Your Sign Intensity will be reduced by this amount for each Death. If you change this value, it will update retroactively but only on a new death or reloading a save.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_31">This will either increase (if positive) or decrease (if negative) the amount of skill experience you earn. A value of 5 would mean that at 10 deaths, you earn +50% XP.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_32">Setting this to a negative value effectively puts a &lsquo;soft&rsquo; limit on how many times you can be revived, as you will eventually be unable to earn enough skills to keep up.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_33">When revived, each piece of equipment will take up to this amount of percentage damage to their current durability.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_34">Aerondight or swords with Bereavement are immune.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_35">A setting of 0 will disable equipment damage.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_36">Your face will bear Gaunter O&rsquo;Dimm&rsquo;s mark. Disabling this option during HoS will remove the mark.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_37">Keep in mind that the mark is not compatible with any of the &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; beard styles that aren&rsquo;t in the progression from clean-shaven to full beard. This is a vanilla issue. If you choose one of these beard styles, the mark will disappear until you reload your game at which point your beard will disappear.</p><p id="-fy5ea9_38">If &lsquo;GOD&rsquo;s Mark&rsquo; is enabled, the mark will only appear when you are at risk of Game Over, either because you lack sufficient skill points for revival or you&rsquo;ve reached your Death Limit. If you earn enough skill points, the mark will disappear, even if you are in the middle of HoS.</p><div class="last-modified">Last modified: 26 March 2024</div><div data-feedback-placeholder="true"></div><div class="navigation-links _bottom"><a href="weather-effects.html" class="navigation-links__prev">Weather Effects</a><a href="difficulty-settings.html" class="navigation-links__next">Difficulty Settings</a></div></article><div id="disqus_thread"></div></div></section></main></div><script src="https://resources.jetbrains.com/writerside/apidoc/6.6.6-b224/app.js"></script></body></html>
