You could even technically play through the entire game now wearing the starting gear if you so desire</p><p id="vqcqk5_5305">This also means that you no longer receive xp as progression to the next level upon completing quests and contracts.

The mod also expands on the bolt selection and provides some new types for different situations</p><p id="vqcqk5_5316">EE also introduces throwing knives, a familiar item if you have ever played Witcher 2.

The quality of the crafted potion will affect how much toxicity is applied each second making higher quality potions more valuable if you intend to drink multiple</p><p id="vqcqk5_5344">Toxicity is a constant battle between Geralts toxicity gain through potions/poisoning and toxicity drain which happens by default (can be improved through skills). The toxicity gain from a potion can be calculated as Total toxicity of potion / Duration. Geralts drain value by default is 0.2, this value will change with toxicity percentage however (at 50% toxicity for example the drain is at 0.1)</p><p id="vqcqk5_5345">Higher levels of toxicity will lower your vigor regeneration up to 50%, this does not scale linearly however but rather exponentially</p><p id="vqcqk5_5346">Reaching maximum toxicity will trigger toxicity fever which will blur your vision, impair your overall effectiveness in combat and cause strong poison damage that can very easily kill you if you do not pay attention. Toxicity fever will only end once your toxicity drops below 90%</p><p id="vqcqk5_5347">When there is no active potion your drain value will be doubled. Meditating will increase this drain value by 5 times, meditation can even be a life saver if you are on the verge of death from toxicity fever</p></section><section class="chapter"><h3 id="crafting-alchemical-items" data-toc="crafting-alchemical-items">Crafting Alchemical Items</h3><p id="vqcqk5_5348">Alchemy is significantly different to the vanilla system now.

Now most monsters will drop a mutagen specific to their monster type. Acquiring more mutagens from other monsters in the same &ldquo;family&rdquo; (e.g. all monsters in the Ogoroid class are a part of the same family but not ones from the Vampire class) allows for the creation of archmutagens. Their recipes can be found by reading books related to monster families</p><p id="vqcqk5_5395">Archmutagens and normal monster mutagens can be equipped in the mutagen slots in the skill menu to apply bonuses.

Geralts speed and damage output will scale based on how much stamina he has meaning at low stamina he hits slower and weaker. Additionally whenever you perform an action consuming stamina your stamina regen briefly stops meaning you cannot stack stamina regen to mitigate the side effects. Also, there is a stamina regen delay which increases depending on how many actions you perform back to back</p><p id="vqcqk5_5492">If you try attacking/dodging when out of stamina you will incur the Overexerted debuff which reduces Geralts speed and damage output, he also takes more poise damage. This debuff will go away after a few seconds provided that you do not perform more stamina consuming actions otherwise you will keep applying the debuff</p><p id="vqcqk5_5493">Stamina efficiency affects the stamina cost of actions and how much delay they incur. They can be split into three specific types: Offensive Stamina Efficiency which covers attacks Defensive Stamina Efficiency which covers parrying and countering Movement Stamina Efficiency which covers dodging and running Stamina Efficiency sources will stack but at a diminishing rate meaning it is more ideal to spread efficiency to all types rather than to one specific type e.g. offence</p><p id="vqcqk5_5494">The armour you wear will also determine how much stamina is consumed per action, heavy armour will of course be more taxing than light armour</p><p id="vqcqk5_5495">In the stamina section of the mod menu are some presets which affect the way in which stamina works overall:</p><dl id="vqcqk5_5496" data-style="title-left" data-title-width="narrow"><dt id="vqcqk5_5497" data-expandable="false">Redux</dt><dd><p id="vqcqk5_5499">The default preset and the most friendly to new players</p></dd><dt id="vqcqk5_5500" data-expandable="false">Dynamic</dt><dd><p id="vqcqk5_5502">High stamina costs but high stamina regen.

Defensive actions like countering and parrying will cost an amount of poise, taking damage also takes away some poise. Running out of poise will stun Geralt and he will be incredibly vulnerable to attacks. Poise has a longer delay than other stats before regenerating. Poise cost and regen delay is affected by defense stamina efficiency. Standing still also reduces regen delay</p><p id="vqcqk5_5508">Enemies also have poise of their own. Draining the poise of a humanoid enemy will allow geralt to perform a finisher instantly killing them. If the poise of a non-humanoid enemy is drained they will take a larger portion of damage and be injured</p><p id="vqcqk5_5509">Poise is affected by the armour you wear. Heavy armour provides more poise than light and medium armour. Certain glyphs, glyphwords and the tiara potion can also increase your poise.

Bleed can be countered with swallow while poison can be countered with golden oriole</p><p id="vqcqk5_5517">Another status effect that can be applied to enemies is Freeze.
